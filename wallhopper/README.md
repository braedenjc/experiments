This project is to create a small game.
The goal of the game is to climb the walls of the level by using walljumps.

Blocks from above will fall. The player must hop between the blocks to get to the top of the level and win.

GOALS:
1)Arcade movement in the form of jumps.
2)Sound effects on jump
3)Add particle effects
4)Improve my grasp on Unity UI.

Start date: 4/29/21
