This was made for a job interview, for a junior programmer position at Atelier Monarch, and had a time constraint of 3 hours.
The goal was to create an RPG styled combat game with a few mechanics, as described in the prompt.
Because it was on such a tight time constraint, programmer art was encouraged.

There are a many things I like about this:
There is some great code here with an eye toward good flexibility and reuse.
The project is well organized, and it has some UI, something I had been meaning to practice for a long time as another experiment.

There are a few things I wish I had time to add:
A health bar or meter.
A better separation of concerns following MVC design. There's some cross-contamination here, so this needs to be cleaned up.
A more interesting UI. Even for a 3 hour experiment, I feel that this a clunky interface and could stand to be made more appealing.
A better method of conveying what was happening, such as damage via sound effects and pop-up text.

What I learned:
Better methods for MVC, better use of OOP principles, extension of objects to manage game states and some ideas for better data back-end management for game object entities.
